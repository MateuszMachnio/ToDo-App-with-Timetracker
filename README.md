# ToDo App with Timetracker

It is a project implemented after passing the fourth module of the course in CodersLab. \
The fourth module was focused on __JavaScript__.
## What programme is that?
The application allows to add tasks to be performed by the user. User can add an operation to each task. \
For each operation, he can manually assign the time spent on the implementation of a given operation, which is each time added to the time he have already spent on the implementation of the operation. \
User can also start a timer at the beginning of performing an operation. It will count the time spent on the implementation of a given operation. \
Tasks can be deleted.
## How it works?
The only permanent element of the page is the form for adding a new task. \
All other elements are added dynamically thanks to specific methods assigned to the "click" event of certain page elements. \
A given event changes the appearance of the page after downloading, saving, editing or deleting data using __REST API__ and __fetch__.
